# git_test_2021

When it comes to working with git and other people is VERY IMPORTANT TO **NEVER** WORK on the MAIN branch.

## Git Steps

1. *Clone* the repo (only need to do this once, after the repo is on your machine you are good)
2. We *create*d a new *branch*
3. We *checkout*ed into the new *branch*
4. We *commit*ed
5. We *push*ed the branch
6. We repeated steps 4 & 5 often to save things in the cloud (GitHub.com)
7. We created a *Pull Request*
8. We *merged* the *pull request* into *main*

------ Other Enginers --------
1. *Checked out* main
2. *fetched* the most recent *commits*
3. *Pulled* main

## When starting a new feature/user-story the steps are
1. *Checkout* *main*
2. *fetch* from *origin*
3. *pull origin* (if needed)
4. *Checkout* a new *branch* (named around the feature)
5. Code
6. *commit*
7. *push*
8. repeat 5-7 as many times as needed
9. Create a *pull request* (can do anytime around steps 5-8)
10. Have someone review the code (we'll cover this later)
11. When ok'd merge the code
12. Delete branch locally and on github
12. Checkout main
13. fetch from origin
14. pull main (if needed)
